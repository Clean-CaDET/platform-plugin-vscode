# Clean CaDET README

The vision and idea behind Clean CaDET is described in this [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBENFfjC49A). Clean CaDET started as a project funded by the [Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia](http://fondzanauku.gov.rs/?lang=en). It hopes to grow into an active open-source community dedicated to software engineers' growth and their pursuit to build sustainable, high-quality software.

This plugin acts as a front-end for software engineers that want to learn about code quality and have their code analyzed. It is meant to interact with the back-end platform. For an overview of the platform and its composing elements, check the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Clean-CaDET/platform/wiki).
